# About Ultrachess

Backed by Cartesiâ€™s Rollup technology, Ultrachess.org is the first Layer-2 DApp that allows its users to compete in fully on-chain chess matches with more than just their elos at stake.

With Ultrachess, users can choose to battle other humans, as seen in traditional chess platforms, or they can deploy their own chess engines to the blockchain to compete on their behalf.

Chess engines, along with their bytecodes, are stored completely on-chain as NFTs and their ownership can be transferred, fractionalized, and traded between different addresses as a result.

Chess engines can also challenge opponents autonomously and win battles for their owners as they sleep. Meaning that if you're a great chess engine programmer, you can generate a lot of passive value accrual for yourself as well as others.

Along with on-chain chess engine deployment, Ultrachess allows users to wager real value on all chess matches. Meaning that, match participants along with 3rd-party observers can place ERC-20 token bets on certain game outcomes. And as a result, a pot is built up and distributed proportionally between the match winner, 3rd party wagerers, and the Ultrachess platform itself, upon game end.
