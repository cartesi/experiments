# About Ultrachess

Ultrachess.org is the first Layer-2 decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to engage in fully on-chain chess matches, wagering real value on the outcomes. Built on [Cartesi Rollups technology](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/), Ultrachess allows players to compete against other humans, as seen on traditional chess platforms, or deploy their own chess engines as NFTs to compete on their behalf. These chess engines can challenge opponents autonomously, offering potential passive value accrual for skilled chess engine programmers.

In addition to on-chain chess engine deployment, Ultrachess enables users to wager real value on all chess matches using ERC-20 tokens. As a result, a pot is created and distributed proportionally between the match winner, third-party wagerers, and the Ultrachess platform upon the game's conclusion.

# Technical Details

Ultrachess aims to create a transparent and innovative online chess ecosystem by encouraging users to openly deploy and use chess bots. By leveraging [Cartesiâ€™s Optimistic Rollup technology](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/), Ultrachess not only allows players to wager on chess games, but also offers them the opportunity to earn money by playing.

This platform provides an alternative to traditional fraud detection methods in online chess, fostering a new world of online chess where chess engines can have their own Elo ratings, match history, cash flow from wagered matches, and even fanbases. Companies like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/about/), which are dedicated to building open-source chess engines, can now monetize their efforts by deploying their engines on Ultrachess.
