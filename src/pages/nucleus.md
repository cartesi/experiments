## About Nucleus

Nucleus is a DeFi lending platform that allows users to deposit funds into a
deposit pool using [Cartesi Rollups](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/),
borrow against their deposits, repay loans, and settle net interest. The
platform also features sophisticated financial analytics that computes
collateral risk limits based on on-chain data represented within Cartesi.

Nucleus aims to provide a seamless lending experience powered by
[Cartesi Rollups technology](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/).

## Technical Details

Nucleus is built on top of Cartesi Rollups, which enables the implementation of
the lending protocol and financial analytics in Python on a
[Linux virtual machine](https://docs.cartesi.io/machine/intro/). The platform
manages the lending process and various actions, such as handling deposits,
withdrawals, borrowings, and price updates, through a smart contract.

The lending protocol employs collateral risk limits, which are calculated based
on the volatility index of major cryptocurrencies (ETH, stablecoins) represented
within Cartesi. These risk limits ensure that borrowers can only borrow up to a
certain amount based on their collateral, thus maintaining a secure lending
environment.

Nucleus's financial analytics component computes the risk parameters for each
asset, enabling the platform to manage risk effectively. This combination of
DeFi lending protocol and financial analytics offers users a powerful and secure
way to participate in decentralized lending activities.
