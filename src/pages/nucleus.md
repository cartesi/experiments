# About Nucleus

This project creates (1) a DeFi lending protocol that allows deposits into a deposit pool on a Cartesi Rollup, borrowing against deposits, repaying them, and settling net interest.

It also creates (2) sophisticated financial analytics that computes collateral risk limits based on on-chain data represented within Cartesi.

# Technical Details

The (1) DeFi lending protocol and (2) financial analytics were coded in Python and run on a Linux virtual machine on Cartesi. Deposits, withdrawals, and settlements are transacted on a Cartesi Hardhat roll up. Onchain data feeds are fed from representations on Cartesi of major cryptocurrencies (ETH, stablecoins).
