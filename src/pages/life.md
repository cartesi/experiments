# About LIFE

Massively-multiplayer on-chain Conway's game of life..with real consequences.

This Conway's Game of Life experience will exist on a 1000X1000 grid. It will be open to anyone with an Ethereum address and run on Cartesi's optimistic rollup solution.

Users are verified through Worldcoin/PolygonID's privacy preserving identity solutions and given a limited amount of blocks they are allowed to submit per day (This is to prevent spam and create a sense of scarcity)

The objective of each user is to fight for control of the grid by placing blocks in a strategic manner such that they own more of the grid than their opponents by the end of a snapshot.

Snapshots of the entire grid are taken by the end of each day (or hour to present the point) and submitted the underlying blockchain as an NFT(image on IPFS/Filecoin). This NFT will be fractionally owned by game participants based on their dominance of the grid.

# Technical Details

- We'll use Worldcoin for identity. (To prevent spam)
- We'll use Cartesi for execution. (For large execution scope)
- We'll use IPFS for storage. (For grid snapshots)
