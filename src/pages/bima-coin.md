# About Bima Coin

In a decentralized world, insuring physical products gets challenging due to the lack of interfacing. With "Bima Coin", we provide an interface between the hardware sensors and the blockchain, to provide insurance to real-world things such as a car, and eventually something like even a vacuum cleaner (i.e. consumer goods insurance).

# Technical Details

Cartesi is used to verify compute.
