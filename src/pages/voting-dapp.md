# About Sotatek’s Voting DApp

This voting DApp was developed on top of Cartesi Rollups and showcases voting functionality. It enables users to vote on candidates in listed campaigns. Furthermore, users can create their own campaigns and add candidate options to vote on. This showcase/module can be used to build more complex DApps and can be utilized for voting in DAOs.

(Please note: Only users that have deposited tokens in the DApp can vote.)

# Technical Details

To save time, resources and make use of already-existing technology, we adopted Python and Cartesi tech instead of learning Solidity or Rust.
