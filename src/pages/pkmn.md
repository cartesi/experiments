  PKMN.fun is a Web3 Pokemon Battle Arena. Players can build their Pokemon teams
  and put them to battle agains other players. Battles are AI simulated. Winners
  rank up in a ELO ranking system. Simulation code is based on the very popular

  lot of possibilities around web3 and Pokemons, where Pokemons as NFTs and
  betting on battles are the most obvious.

## About PKMN.fun

Under the hood we use code from Pokemon Showdown at https://github.com/pkmn/ps
to simulate battles between two teams. This is executed inside a Cartesi
Coprocessor and result is sent back onchain, with the battle winner, the ELO
delta, and the entire log of the battle.

## What's next

NFTs! Pokemons are perfect use case for NFT. And with PKMN.fun their battles are
validated.
