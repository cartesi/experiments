## About Housy

Welcome to Housy, the groundbreaking platform where real estate and innovation
converge to reshape the future of property rental. With the real estate market
projected to reach a staggering 5.85 trillion dollars by 2030, Housy is
revolutionizing the way properties are rented and managed.

### The Challenge

Excessive taxation has long been a burden on landlords and tenants alike,
hindering real estate activity and economic growth. High tax rates on rental
profits diminish property owners' earnings, discouraging investments and
limiting housing availability. This not only affects landlords but also results
in higher rents for tenants, particularly in competitive real estate markets.
Housy aims to strike a fair balance between taxation and incentivizing rental
market investment, promoting a healthier, more accessible real estate ecosystem.

### Rent Auctions

Housy introduces Rent Auctions, a novel concept where prospective tenants bid on
rental properties. This competitive environment ensures that both tenants and
landlords benefit from market-driven rental rates. By connecting individuals
directly and encouraging healthy competition, Housy fosters a vibrant ecosystem
that benefits everyone involved.

### Taxation Made Simple

With Housy, rental income is taxed according to capital gains taxation rules.
This means a fixed Income Tax rate of 15% on the profit obtained in the
operation, simplifying the tax process for real estate companies.

### Transparency and Credibility

Housy incorporates auctions, providing a transparent and public process for
property sales. This enhances the credibility of the platform and fosters trust
among investors and buyers. Blockchain technology underpins the entire system,
creating an immutable record of all transactions, ensuring the authenticity of
asset history.

### Maximizing Value

Competitive auctions on Housy maximize the value of auctioned assets. Buyer
competition can drive up bids, resulting in higher final prices for sellers on
the platform.

### How It's Made

Housy is not just an idea; it's a real-world application. Our roadmap includes
finance services and AI credit risk analysis. With Cartesi's cutting-edge
technology, we're developing our DApp using Python, Rust, and JS, providing
flexibility beyond Solidity development.

Join Housy and be part of the future of real estate rentalsâ€”where transparency,
fairness, and innovation reign.
