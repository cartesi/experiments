## About Titanic survivor

A DApp by Locus Software, powered by Cartesi

This DApp is one from a series of DApps born from the partnership of Locus
Custom Software and Cartesi. The main objective was to bring common concepts
from Web2 to Web3 through Cartesi Rollups technology.

The Titanic DApp collects input data (such as age, gender, etc.) to predict if a
person would survive something as epic as the sinking of the Titanic.

## Technical Details

The Titanic Survivor DApp uses Logistic Regression from Scikit-Learn and the
m2cgen library for the prediction step. This prediction, and all the
computation, are done on-chain thanks to the Cartesi API.
