## About BugLess

Bug bounty programs allow developers to discover vulnerabilities in their
applications by rewarding hackers that find them. They are mostly held in the
Web2 space, and, thus, rarely provide any form of payment guarantee to
whitehats. As a result, developers are able to unfairly underpay whitehats, or
even refuse to pay them.

To solve this issue, we have developed BugLessâ€”a trustless bug bounty platform
powered by Cartesi Rollups. Running inside a deterministic RISC-V machine that
boots Linux, BugLess accepts applications written in any major programming
language. Through a friendly web interface, anyone can submit applications, and
sponsor them with Ether to incentivize hackers! All major wallets are supported.
Meanwhile, hackers can test their exploits right on the browser, without even
having to sign Web3 transactions! Once the hacker finds a valid exploit, they
can finally send a transaction requesting the reward to be transferred to their
account. If, however, no one is able to submit a valid exploit until a certain
deadline, the sponsors may request a refund.

In order to be accepted, an application must be formatted in a specific way.
First, it should be compiled to RISC-V machine code. Second, it must be bundled
as a tarball compressed with xz (\*.tar.xz), together with a "start.sh" file
that serves as the entry point for the application. Then, whenever someone
submits an exploit, the back-end will run the "start.sh" file in a sandbox,
while feeding the exploit to it through the standard input stream. BugLess does
not enforce any specific format for the exploit. It can be in whichever language
the application submitter may prefer. For example, Lua might be preferred for
testing a Lua library, while SQL might be better suited for testing the SQLite
database engine.

The back-end of BugLess is mostly written in the Go language, using the Eggroll
framework developed by one of our team members, Gabriel Ligneul. In the
back-end, applications are run in a controlled environment that isolates
processes, limits resources and filters system calls. This is possible thanks to
bwrapbox, a Linux sandboxing utility also developed by one of our team members,
Eduardo Barthel.

Meanwhile, the front-end is written in Typescript and uses the Next.js
framework. For interacting with smart contracts, we use Wagmi and Viem, and all
the major wallets are supported thanks to the Web3Modal library. To provide a
good UX, we have used the React components from the Mantine library. Also,
GraphQL queries are made in the front-end with the Apollo library.

Apart from back-end and front-end code, a substantial part of the codebase
focuses on testing BugLess with real-world applications such as Lua, SQLite and
BusyBox. To this end, we use Docker for building these applications to RISC-V,
and Lua for writing test cases. We can interact with the DApp through the web
UI, but also through a CLI tool written in Go.

## Describe what could be next for your project?

The initial version of this project was developed in one week. During this
period, we had to design and implement the project from scratch. With this very
tight schedule, some of the features were left out for later implementation.
Below are some of those features.

- Support ENS
- Support other types of assets (ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155)
- Support syntax highlight on code blocks
- Add optional one-time setup phase for applications
- Add option to download bounty bundle
- Sandbox applications with Hypervisor
