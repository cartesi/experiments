## About OnChain Fans

The solution provides a trustless and decentralized way to sell digital content
based on community-driven incentives.

- Artists & Content Creators can sell digital art, images, or exclusive content
  while ensuring that buyers collectively unlock the full-quality version once a
  pre-set goal is met.
- Crowdsourced Unlocking of Content allows multiple buyers to contribute towards
  a goal instead of relying on a single purchase.
- Blockchain-Based Transparency guarantees that the original image will only be
  revealed after reaching the required sales threshold.

## What's next

- Update contracts to accept multiple buyers
- Integrate database and IPFS to upload images
- Mint the NFT after purchase
