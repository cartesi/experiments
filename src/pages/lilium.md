## About Lilium

Auction System üåê: The Auction DApp module is designed to auction carbon credit
tokens from producers with forest reserves, providing companies with a platform
to bid on these tokens to offset their carbon emissions. The entire auction
logic is embedded within the Cartesi Machine, ensuring unparalleled security and
transparency in the auction process.

AI-Powered Anomaly Detection ü§ñ: The Verifier DApp module incorporates two AI
models within a Cartesi Machine to ensure the accuracy and security of the
generated tokens. The first model, utilizing TensorFlow, performs image
detection to ensure optimal conservation of the area associated with carbon
credit production. The second model, developed using the Sklearn Elliptic
Envelope, identifies anomalies in humidity, temperature, and CO levels in the
forest reserve, ensuring the integrity of the carbon credits generated.

IoT System üì°: An IoT system, consisting of temperature and humidity sensors, a
volatile gas (CO) meter, and a camera, is deployed in forest reserve areas. The
collected data is transmitted to the AI models, ensuring the consistent
monitoring and verification of the environmental conditions of the area, further
enhancing the reliability of the carbon credits generated.

## Describe what could be next for your project?

The Lilium DApp project has room for practical improvements and valuable
contributions to the Cartesi ecosystem. Firstly, we can focus on enhancing the
user interface (UI) to make it more user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a
smoother experience for users. Another practical step is to integrate the code
with real, scalable IoT devices, which would increase the reliability of data
and expand the project's applicability. By connecting Lilium DApp with other
decentralized applications in the Cartesi ecosystem, we can explore new use
cases and synergies, making it a more practical and impactful solution for
environmental conservation. This collaborative approach can drive adoption and
further development, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.
