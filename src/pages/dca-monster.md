# About DCA Monster

While on-chain DCA solutions do exist, they are uncommon and frequently accompanied by an array of difficulties. DCA.Monster was created to address these issues by developing a new AMM based on Uniswap V2 that seamlessly combines with Streamable tokens and runs a Cartesi Rollup.

## Current on-chain DCA solutions suffer from:

- Dependence on third-party bots or keepers to execute transactions
- Capital inefficiency as it remains locked in smart contracts between transactions
- Inability to integrate with DEXs
- Gas inefficiency
- Lack of granularity in price range
- Lack of flexibility in time range

DCA.Monster AMM merges with ERC20 streams to efficiently and with infinite granularity, implement DCA on-chain. It optimizes capital and gas usage, integrates with DEXs, and provides both granular pricing and flexible timing.

Without [Cartesi Rollups](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/), such an implementation would be computationally expensive due to the complex calculations required for AMM streams recalculations. However, Cartesi Rollups enables us to perform these computations off-chain on any device, with the results verified on-chain.

# How it's Made

Our implementation consists of both a frontend and a DApp/backend:

## DApp/backend

- AMM based on Uniswap V2 written in Python combined with Streamable tokens also written in Python that combine seamlessly with the AMM to create a DCA experience.
- Built upon the [Cartesi dapp rollups-examples custom dapp starter](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/custom-dapps)
- Uses RISC-V base Docker images to install Python dependencies
- Ready for "prod" mode operation

## Frontend

Utilizes the template-web3-app from TurboETH that incorporates:

- Rainbow kit for wallet connection: Metamask, WalletConnect, Portis, Torus, Authereum, Fortmatic, and Squarelink
- Next JS for frontend framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web3 React for Ethereum JavaScript API
- Wagmi and RainbowKit for additional functionality
- background image
