# About Iris Classifier

A DApp by Locus Software, powered by Cartesi

This DApp is one from a series of DApps born from the partnership of Locus Custom Software and Cartesi. The main objective was to bring common concepts from Web2 to Web3 through Cartesi Rollups technology.

The Iris classifier uses KNN supervised learning to predict what flower the user is inputting to the DApp.

# Technical Details

The first approach was to classify the iris flower dataset using KNN (k-nearest neighbors algorithm) and then implement the classification using Python. The prediction and computation take place on-chain using the Cartesi API.
