## About CarteSign

Most digital signatures are not legally binding making the blockchain smart
contracts null and void with respect to the laws of different countries. The
idea of a decentralized world can only be achieved if we can integrate the
existing institutions into web3. CarteSign is a tool that allows you to tokenize
your unique handwritten signature which can be used to sign Digital smart
contracts. Handwritten biometrics-based contracts perform much better under
legal scrutiny than digital signatures. This tool can also be used to mint
memorable messages as NFTs and be shared among friends and family, or they can
be used to authenticate digital collectibles in the form of autographs and can
be traded online. This project uses Cartesi at its core for acting as the
marketplace platform and the Signature analysis platform. Cartesi also performs
the task of managing assets in a layer2 platform. CarteSign also uses Arbitrum
and Optimism to mint nfts at a much lower price compared to the mainnet. We have
a react-based frontend with wallet-connect integration to facilitate ease of
transactions.
