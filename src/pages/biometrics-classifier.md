# About Biometrics Classifier

A DApp by Locus Software, powered by Cartesi

This DApp is one from a series of DApps born from the partnership of Locus Custom Software and Cartesi. The main objective was to bring common concepts from Web2 to Web3 through Cartesi Rollups technology.

This DApp is the ultimate result of all concepts present in the other DApps plus machine learning, computer vision and feature extraction. All this is used to perform a decentralized biometrics spoof detection, and all the computation is done inside the blockchain, thanks to the Cartesi API. Bringing those kinds of concepts to the blockchain is one of the benefits of using the Cartesi solution.

# Technical Details

This DApp uses machine learning, computer vision, and feature extraction to perform a decentralized biometrics spoof detection on-chain. Beyond verifying whose fingerprints were used, this program checks for spoofing.

We used C++ with OpenCV to extract the features of the fingerprints. These features are then fed into a Python program that decides whether it’s a fake fingerprint or a real one.
