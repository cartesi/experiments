## About Bravo

This example represents a complete project that implements the feature offered
by the [Cartesi VM](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-machine/) to execute
arbitrary code from a smart contract. This example allows us to understand the
power of composability within Cartesi.

The main goal of this PoC is to give the idea that Cartesi can be used also to
execute specific code inside a more complex architecture written in Solidity (or
any other smart contract language).

## How it's Made

Bravo demonstrates the Cartesi VM's potential for executing arbitrary code
within smart contracts. Using Solidity & Python, it enables composability within
Cartesi and a generic smart contract. The project implements hex input/output
encoding, voucher emission, generic address calls, and frontend-console
interactions. It's a PoC that’s almost production-ready, user-friendly and
simple to understand. It allows users to better understand that Cartesi can also
be widely used in existing projects.
