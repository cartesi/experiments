# About Bravo

This example represents a complete project that implements the feature offered by the [Cartesi VM](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-machine/) to execute arbitrary code from a smart contract. This example allows us to understand the power of composability within Cartesi.

The main goal of this PoC is to give the idea that Cartesi can be used also to execute specific code inside a more complex architecture written in Solidity (or any other smart contract language).

# How it's Made

Bravo demonstrates the Cartesi VM's potential for executing arbitrary code within smart contracts. Using Solidity & Python, it enables composability within Cartesi and a generic smart contract. The project implements hex input/output encoding, voucher emission, generic address calls, and frontend-console interactions. It's a PoC that’s almost production-ready, user-friendly and simple to understand. It allows users to better understand that Cartesi can also be widely used in existing projects.
