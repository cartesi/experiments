## About Rives

Rives is a Cartesi App-chain that at it´s core has a gameplay validation
primitive. At the core of Rives there is a deterministic fantasy console
emulator, called RIV. RIV is built on top of the Cartesi Machine and executes
both on the browser on top of web assembly when users are playing a game and
inside the Rives app-chain validators. In that way, the computation performed by
users is deterministic and can be verified without the developers needing to
take any special care for their games to be deterministic. RIV has an API for
game developers to use on their games allowing to play sounds, capture user
input and draw on the screen among other things. The API documentation is
available at https://docs.rives.io . On top of the core validation primitive,
Rives has other functionalities like the tapes (replays of the gameplay) and
contests (time constrained tournaments with specific rules for a game). As the
validation of Rives computations are very demanding, we use an architecture we
call inception optimistic rollups to scale the processing capability. Basically
every validation of gameplay is an optimistic computation that has it´s result
published on the Rives app-chain when final. To scale the read-only part, we
have a cache mechanism to serve static assets and dynamic ones that are fetched
through inspects. Additionally we have created a "reader node" based on
[nonodo](https://github.com/Calindra/nonodo) that serves inspects based on the
current externalized state of Rives, which can scale horizontally inspect
requests. You can join [Rives Discord](https://discord.gg/FQnQqKWVn8) to talk to
the team and clear any technical doubts.

## What's next

We are progressively building more features for all the different user groups in
game communities: players, pro-players, fans, streamers, game developers, etc to
make all the people involved on a game community share the value generated by it
and create virtuous cycles around the community. Rives is spearheading solving
multiple novel technical problems for Cartesi Rollups and working close to the
core team to create solutions that benefit the entire ecosystem, making Cartesi
DApps easier to develop, maintain and more stable/scalable.
