## About Cartesi Super Soccer

1. Using cartesi Co-Processor it solves the problem of settlement times by
   enabling fast base layer updates. For example, NFT XP stats are adjusted
   instantly after each match, ensuring immediate feedback and seamless
   progression for users. This is made possible by leveraging the Cartesi
   Co-Processor, which efficiently processes and finalizes updates without the
   usual delays of on-chain settlements.

2. Ollama is a powerful tool that makes it easy to run a wide range of AI models
   locally, and it fits perfectly within the Cartesi ecosystem. By integrating
   Ollama, developers can seamlessly bring AI capabilities to their
   decentralized applications without relying on centralized infrastructure.

3. Drand is a decentralized randomness beacon that provides verifiable,
   unbiased, and publicly available randomness. It enhances security and
   fairness in blockchain applications, making it a great fit for Cartesi and
   other decentralized systems.

## What's next

1. Fix Ollama Conflict with Notice Resolving compatibility issues between Ollama
   and the notice mechanism to ensure smooth AI-driven interactions within the
   Cartesi ecosystem.

2. Bartel Matmul Acceleration Optimizing matrix multiplication using Bartel’s
   acceleration techniques to improve computational efficiency in Cartesi
   applications.

3. NFT Progress (Page After a Match) Implementing a seamless post-match results
   page that updates NFT progression instantly, enhancing user experience and
   engagement.

4. Cartesi Rollups Integration Expanding Cartesi’s Rollups support to store and
